# Olympic_Medal_Predictor

This project will be focused on the Olympics, the relationship between participants, medal achievers and participants who dopped to win/won medals during a certain period of the event. The purpose is to determine if countries who have the highest number of doping cases also have the highest number of medals.

The dataset comprises of athletes who have participated at the Olympics from 1896 â€“ 2016, along ineligible athletes for doping.

Machine learning model would be used to predict the relationship and Tableau to relate through presentation

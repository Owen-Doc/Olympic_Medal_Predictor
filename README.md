# Olympic_Medal_Predictor
We'll be creating a machine learning model to predict medal counts for countries using historical Olympic performance data, dating back to 1900. As we explore the dataset further for both quality and completeness, we'll make some decisions about where to drop some data as some fields have missing values. 
We'll be utillizing Tableau to create and tell a story and present our model. There is also a component that we would like to introduce as a portion of the story, the topic of doping. There is an extensive database available of all past and current offenders, and it may be interesting to look at the doping data side by side with the Olympic medal predictor model.
We chose this area for our project because sports analytics is a huge industry, and the Olympics are starting in a little over a month. There is quality data available and previous research to draw from. 

The SQL_Connection notebook file contains the code to read in the csv, clean it up and drop NA values, and then connect to a local postgres server, and create a table when that cell is ran. 

The ML learning model preprocessing can be found in CarlysBranch.

# Olympic_Medal_Predictor
We'll be creating a machine learning model to predict medal counts for countries using historical Olympic performance data, dating back to 1900. As we explore the dataset further for both quality and completeness, we'll make some decisions about where to drop some data as some fields have missing values.

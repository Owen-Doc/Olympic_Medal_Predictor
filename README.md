# Olympic_Medal_Predictor

The goal for this final project is to utilize our skills in data wrathing, ETL and relational databases to build out a machine learning model (supervised) 


## Data Features and Resources:

Main dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results  [athlete_events.csv.zip](https://github.com/Owen-Doc/Olympic_Medal_Predictor/tree/main/Resources/athlete_events.csv.zip) 
using data here to update the dataset for the 2022 olympics https://github.com/rgriff23/Olympic_history

Ineligible athletes list from https://www.athleticsintegrity.org/disciplinary-process/global-list-of-ineligible-persons
tool to convert PDF to excel https://simplypdf.com/Excel to[May-2021-Sanctions-List-Full.xlsx](https://github.com/Owen-Doc/Olympic_Medal_Predictor/tree/main/Resources/May-2021-Sanctions-List-Full.xlsx) 


- Topic

1. A machine learning model to predict 2021 Olympic medal counts for different countries, with a consideration for doping status/history using data from 1900 back.
2. One of the challenges is merging the doping history with the Olympic performance data – when an athlete is found guilty, they are removed from the medal data.
3. Home field advantage question?
4. Favorite sports by country?
5. On the dataset, make sure we specify that the medal column is converted from “NA” to “No Medal”

- Tools

1. Python tools to scrape data, beautiful Soup

2. Tableau for Heat maps weigh medal winners/counts vs home field advantage?

3. Statistics: need to look into position or possible time results for races?

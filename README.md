# Olympic_Medal_Predictor

This project will be focused on the Olympics, the relationship between participants, medal achievers and participants who dopped to win/won medals during a certain period of the event. The purpose is to determine if countries who have the highest number of doping cases also have the highest number of medals.

The dataset comprises of athletes who have participated at the Olympics from 1896 â€“ 2016, along ineligible athletes for doping.

Machine learning model would be used to predict the relationship and Tableau to relate through presentation

The machine learning codes are found in [Carly's github page](https://github.com/Owen-Doc/Olympic_Medal_Predictor/tree/Carly)

The database connection strings and code are found in [Owen's github page](https://github.com/Owen-Doc/Olympic_Medal_Predictor/tree/OwensBranch)

The ReadMe of the main branch shows a proper breakdown of the project. It reveals the tools used on the dataset to give a high accuracy of predicting the initial outcome through relevant features. Visualization of the dataset amongst features were also included from tableau to give more light into understanding

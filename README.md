# Olympic_Medal_Predictor
Data and configurations:

$ git clone --branch paul git@github.com:Owen-Doc/Olympic_Medal_Predictor.git

Main dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results  [athlete_events.csv.zip](Resources/athlete_events.csv.zip) 
using data here to update the dataset for the 2022 olympics https://github.com/rgriff23/Olympic_history

May pull (additional) data from http://www.olympedia.org/ in order to get the last winter Olympics data included in the dataset and any additional suspensions that would have caused an athlete to be removed from Medals Standings. Also of note Junior Olympics data is in that dataset 

Ineligible athletes list from https://www.athleticsintegrity.org/disciplinary-process/global-list-of-ineligible-persons

- Topic

1. A machine learning model to predict 2021 Olympic medal counts for different countries, with a consideration for doping status/history.
2. One of the challenges is merging the doping history with the Olympic performance data – when an athlete is found guilty, they are removed from the medal data.
3. Home field advantage question?
4. Favorite sports by country?
5. On the dataset, make sure we specify that the medal column is converted from “NA” to “No Medal”

- Tools

1. GitHub – Repo created by Owen, link is in Slack channel

1. Need to create branches and make at least 4 commits per week
2. Manage access  Add Collaborator  Now can create branch from main
3. Carly, let one of us know when you get a minute to get connected to the Github repo because the process of becoming a collaborator is a bit of a pain with branches and stuff, but Paul has it down pretty well.

1. On Tuesday, let’s aim to decide what specific tools we’ll be using, obviously Python, Pandas, visualization libraries but what else will we need.

# Olympic_Medal_Predictor
We'll be creating a machine learning model to predict medal counts for countries using historical Olympic performance data, dating back to 1900. As we explore the dataset further for both quality and completeness, we'll make some decisions about where to drop some data as some fields have missing values. 
We'll be utillizing Tableau to create and tell a story and present our model. There is also a component that we would like to introduce as a portion of the story, the topic of doping. There is an extensive database available of all past and current offenders, and it may be interesting to look at the doping data side by side with the Olympic medal predictor model.
We chose this area for our project because sports analytics is a huge industry, and the Olympics are starting in a little over a month. There is quality data available and previous research to draw from.

# Olympic_Medal_Predictor

## INTRODUCTION

Full of blood, passion and extraordinary feats of athletic endeavour, the Olympic Games were the sporting, social and cultural highlight of the Ancient Greek calendar for almost 12 centuries. The modern Olympic Games or Olympics are leading international sporting events featuring summer and winter sports competitions in which thousands of athletes from around the world participate in a variety of competitions. The Olympic Games are considered the world's foremost sports competition with more than 200 nations participating. The Olympic Games are normally held every four years, alternating between the Summer and Winter Olympics every two years in the four-year period.

However, during the early 20th century, many Olympic athletes discovered ways to improve their athletic abilities by boosting testosterone. As their methods became more extreme, it became increasingly evident that the use of performance-enhancing drugs was not only a threat to the integrity of sport but could also have potentially fatal side effects on the athlete.

### GOAL

The essence for this final project is to improvise on data wrangling, ETL, relational databases and statistical visualization to:
  - Create a supervised machine learning model to predict the 2021 Olympic medal counts for competing countries. 
  - Examine supplementary doping/disqualification data to quantify its correlation to the performance of the data metrics and athlete categorical metadata.
